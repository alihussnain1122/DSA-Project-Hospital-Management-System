**Proposal for Hospital Management System**  

**Introduction:**  
This project aims to develop a robust **Hospital Management System** using advanced **Data Structures** to streamline hospital operations. The system focuses on enhancing patient record management, appointment scheduling, resource optimization, and historical data handling.

**Problem Statement:**  
Hospitals face challenges in managing patient records, appointments, and resource allocation, often leading to inefficiencies, delays, and errors. Traditional systems lack scalability and real-time responsiveness. This project addresses these challenges by utilizing efficient data structures.

**Proposed Solution:**  
The system leverages the following:  
- **Binary Search Trees (BST):** For quick and organized patient record storage and retrieval.  
- **Queues:** To manage appointments effectively.  
- **Graphs:** For optimizing hospital resource allocation.  
- **Stacks:** For implementing undo functionality, enabling error recovery.  
- **Linked Lists:** To handle dynamic patient queues and maintain historical data.  
- **Sorting Algorithms:** For prioritizing patient data based on urgency.  

**Objectives:**  
1. Streamline hospital workflows for better operational efficiency.  
2. Reduce errors and improve data accessibility.  
3. Provide dynamic scheduling and resource optimization.  

**Project Features:**  
1. Patient Record Management  
2. Appointment Scheduling  
3. Resource Allocation Optimization  
4. Undo Functionality  
5. Data Prioritization and Sorting  

**Conclusion:**  
This Hospital Management System will enhance efficiency, minimize delays, and ensure seamless operations in a hospital environment.
